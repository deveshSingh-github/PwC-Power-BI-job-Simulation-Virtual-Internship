# PwC-Power-BI-job-Simulation-Virtual-Internship

This was the Power BI virtual case experience internship provided by PwC. There I worked on three different dashboard for Call Center Analysis, Churn Rate Analysis, and Diversity & Inclusion Analysis. 

The tasks brought a lot of learning to me, they helped me to learn the effective way of story telling through visuals.
